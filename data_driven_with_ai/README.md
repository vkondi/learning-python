# Data-Driven Solutions with AI

## Overview

The **Data Driven with AI** project showcases various artificial intelligence applications in sales data analysis using Python. This project aims to demonstrate how data-driven decision-making can enhance business strategies through predictive analytics, customer segmentation, recommendation systems, churn prediction, and anomaly detection.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Python scripts, each implementing a specific AI use case:

- `sales_forecasting.py`: Implements sales forecasting using historical sales data.
- `customer_segmentation.py`: Segments customers based on purchasing behavior using K-means clustering.
- `recommendation_system.py`: Suggests products to customers based on their purchase history using collaborative filtering.
- `churn_prediction.py`: Predicts customer churn using logistic regression.
- `anomaly_detection.py`: Detects anomalies in sales data using Isolation Forest.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Pip (Python package manager)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to root folder
```bash
cd data_driven_with_ai
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv env
